  <h2 style = "text-align:center"> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, studying Mathematics and Economics. 
      I previously attended Denison University as a QuestBridge Scholar. For work, I am interested in Data Analytics and work involving Economics. 
      My Data Analytics related interests are Machine Learning, Causal Inference, Systems Dynamics, and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).
      In terms of Economics, I am interested in Finance and Industrial Organization.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my work, I hope to bring underutilized tools to organizations in order to expand their analytical arsenal. In particular, there is extensive work
      on <a href = "https://systemdynamics.org/what-is-system-dynamics/" target = "_blank">Systems Dynamics</a>
      and <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/agent-based-modeling" target = "_blank">Agent-Based Modeling</a>, but there is little use of them in industry-applications. 
      Even Causal Inference is something not used extensively, even though many 
      <a href = "https://building.nubank.com/beyond-prediction-machines/" target = "_blank">data analytics questions wound up requiring Causal Inference</a>. 

    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I like keeping up with the NBA, reading manga, manhwa, and webnovels, as well as learning a new thing here and there.
      My favorite board game (as you may guess) is Connect Four.
    </p>




  <h2 style = "text-align:center"> Current Projects </h2>

  <div style = "text-align:center">
    <img src = "images/pringleschip.png" alt = "Me, myself, and I", style = "width:300px;height:300px;">
  </div>

    I work on many projects that live on GitHub as repositories (including this site!), here are some of the projects that I am currently working on.
      <ul>
          <li> Estimating Hawaii's Recession Risk using DoomBot </li>
          <li> Oceania Economic Outlook with Climate Change in Mind </li>
          <li> Does Sports Betting Legalization Affect Unemployment? </li>
      </ul>
    

  <h3 style = "text-align:center"> Site Inspiration </h3> 
      <p>
      I want this website to be similar to <a href = "https://berkshirehathaway.com" target = "_blank"> Berkshire Hathaway's website</a> or the original <a href = "https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.html" target = "_blank">Space Jam 
        promotional site from 1996</a>, simple, mildly ugly, but long-lasting.
      That might not be the case because of how browsers may change over the next several years/decades, but building it statically in mostly HTML will help tremendously.
      </p>
