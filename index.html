  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, studying Mathematics and Economics. 
    My Data Science related interests are Machine Learning, Causal Inference, Systems Dynamics, and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).
    In terms of Economics, I am interested in Finance and Industrial Organization. For mathematics, it would be Probability theory.

    I will... probably add in the projects later in some better way. As of right now, settle for GitHub pages.
      <ul>
          <li> Estimating Hawaii's Recession Risk using DoomBot </li>
          <li> Oceania Economic Outlook with Climate Change in Mind </li>
          <li> Something with competition theory </li>

      </ul>

      <p>
      I want this website to be similar to <a href = "https://berkshirehathaway.com"> Berkshire Hathaway's website</a> or the original <a href = "https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.html">Space Jam promotional site from 1996</a>, simple, but long-lasting.
      That might not be the case because of how browsers may change over the next several years/decades, but building it statically in mostly HTML will help tremendously.
